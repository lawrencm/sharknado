    "body": "Hey there, Fin Shepard here. I’ve had my fair share of run-ins with our finned friends being flung around by tornadoes, and let me tell you, sharks are just not cut out for storm chasing.\n\nFirst off, sharks are terrible at navigating weather patterns. Ever tried asking a shark for directions? Trust me, they don't do well with maps. They’d rather be swimming in the ocean, not swirling around in a tornado. And don’t even get me started on their lack of weather gear. Can you imagine a shark trying to wear a raincoat?\n\nSecondly, sharks in tornadoes are a logistical nightmare. Trying to get them organized for an evacuation plan is like herding cats—if the cats were big, hungry, and had very sharp teeth. They’re more interested in finding their next meal than understanding the concept of storm safety.\n\nSo next time you think about chasing a storm, leave the sharks out of it. They’ve got enough to worry about with trying not to get stuck in a tornado, and frankly, I’m tired of rescuing them from themselves!"

    "body": "Hi, April Wexler here. As someone who’s had a front-row seat to the chaos that is a Sharknado, let me tell you: tornadoes and sharks are a combination that should never happen again.\n\nImagine trying to deal with the aftermath of a tornado. Now add sharks to that mix. It’s like trying to fix a leaky roof while someone throws fish at you. The combination of wind, debris, and angry sharks makes for a particularly bad day. And don’t even think about trying to clean up the mess—sharks don’t exactly help with housework.\n\nPlus, tornadoes make it nearly impossible to rescue anyone. Sharks are flying everywhere, making it hard to tell which direction is up. It’s a real nightmare trying to coordinate a rescue when you’re dodging sharks and debris at the same time.\n\nSo, to anyone thinking of combining tornadoes and sharks, please reconsider. It’s a recipe for disaster—and not the kind that makes good television."

    "body": "Hey, it’s Finn the Shark. Ever wondered what it’s like to be a shark caught in a tornado? Let me tell you, it’s not as glamorous as it sounds.\n\nFor starters, tornadoes are really bumpy rides. It’s like being on the world’s worst amusement park ride—one with no safety restraints and a lot of really confused sharks. Ever tried to swim in a tornado? Not easy, let me tell you. We sharks prefer calm, deep waters, not swirling vortexes of doom.\n\nAnd let’s talk about food. One minute you’re hunting for a nice meal, and the next, you’re airborne with a mouthful of debris. It’s not exactly gourmet dining. Plus, it’s hard to enjoy a good bite when you’re constantly spinning around.\n\nSo, while the idea of a Sharknado sounds exciting, the reality is pretty rough. Tornadoes are great for causing chaos, but not so much for making sharks happy."

Trust me, I’ve been there, and these tips could save your life.\n\nFirst, always keep an eye on the skies. If you see a tornado, assume it’s about to get a lot worse. Sharks tend to be very predictable—until they’re suddenly airborne. If you see fins in the sky, you’re in trouble.\n\nSecond, don’t try to fight the tornado. Instead, find shelter and stay low. Tornadoes are powerful, and sharks in the mix only make things worse. Get to a sturdy building and keep away from windows. You don’t want to end up shark bait.\n\nFinally, if you do encounter flying sharks, keep calm and move quickly. Sharks are just as disoriented as you are, and they’re not interested in making friends. Stay safe, stay smart, and remember, Sharknadoes are no joke."

    "body": "Hello, Finn the Shark here, and I’ve got some thoughts on the so-called science behind sharks in tornadoes. Spoiler alert: It’s not very scientific.\n\nFirst off, let’s talk physics. Sharks are great swimmers, but even we have our limits. The idea that a tornado could pick us up from the ocean and fling us around like toys is pretty far-fetched. I mean, have you seen a tornado? They’re powerful, but they’re not designed for shark transportation.\n\nSecondly, sharks don’t do well in the air. We’re built for swimming, not flying. Ever tried to swim in a blender? That’s what it feels like. It’s not a pleasant experience, and it’s definitely not one we signed up for.\n\nIn summary, while the idea of sharks in tornadoes makes for a fun movie, it’s not exactly grounded in reality. But hey, if it keeps the humans entertained, we’ll roll with it. Just don’t ask us to explain the science behind it."

Sharks and tornadoes are already a dangerous combination, and you don’t want to add a fire hazard into the mix. Stick to sturdy, non-flammable fabrics—fashion should be functional, especially in a crisis.\n\nSecond, don’t wear anything that you wouldn’t want to get covered in debris. Tornadoes are messy, and flying sharks can make things even worse. Opt for practical attire that can handle a bit of chaos.\n\nFinally, don’t forget the importance of footwear. You’ll be running from sharks and debris, so make sure your shoes are comfortable and durable. High heels might look great, but they’re not exactly ideal for escaping a tornado."

We’ve developed a keen sense for where the safest spots are—well, as safe as they can be in a Sharknado.\n\nLastly, be ready to adapt.

Sharks need to get used to the idea of being airborne, so we practice swimming in circles while imagining a tornado is swirling around us. It’s not glamorous, but it helps.\n\nNext, we work on coordination. Sharks need to learn how to avoid colliding with each other while flying through a tornado. It’s a bit like a chaotic dance class—lots of bumping into each other and trying to stay in sync.\n\nFinally, we have stress management sessions. Being tossed around by a tornado can be stressful, so we teach sharks how to stay calm under pressure. It’s all part of making sure they’re ready for the next Sharknado."
